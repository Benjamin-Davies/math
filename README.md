This repository contains various projects that are based on maths concepts.

### [Opposite Corners](./OppositeCorners/)
> Hello From The Other Side

This finds the country on the other side of the globe, or the Antipodal Point.

### [Pi Calculator](./PiCalculator/)
This is a variety of ways that you can approximate pi.

### [Conway's Game of Life](./GameOfLife/)
This is the traditional Game of Life... with a twist. There are two different colours and when a cell is born it recieves the color of the majority of it's parents. There will always be a dominant colour because a in order to be born a cell must have three live neighboors and three is odd. Once it is given a color, the cell keeps its colour until it dies.

### [Restosphene's Sieve](./RestosphenesSieve/)
A Resptosphene's Sieve is a grid where you systematicaly cross out all of the composite numbers and you are left with all of the primes. Usualy the top left corner is one but I made it be zero because it made it easier to implement. Also there are no numbers drawn; I only filled in the squares.

### [Multiplication Circles](./MultiplicationCircles/)
This uses modular or 'clock' arithematic; so called because of it's appearance in analogue clocks. A series of points are placed evenly around a circle's circumference and are labeled with numbers starting at zero. A number is also chosen to multiply by. Then each point is connected to the point with the number `tn mod p` where *t* is the number chosen to multiply by, *n* is the number of the starting point, and *p* is the total number of points.
