This repository contains various projects that are based on maths concepts.

### [Conway's Game of Life](./GameOfLife/)
This is the traditional Game of Life... with a twist. There are two different colours and when a cell is born it recieves the color of the majority of it's parents. There will always be a dominant colour because a in order to be born a cell must have three live neighboors and three is odd. Once it is given a color, the cell keeps its colour until it dies.

### [Restosphene's Sieve](./RestosphenesSieve/)
A Resptosphene's Sieve is a grid where you systematicaly cross out all of the composite numbers and you are left with all of the primes. Usualy the top left corner is one but I made it be zero because it made it easier to implement. Also there are no numbers drawn; I only filled in the squares.
