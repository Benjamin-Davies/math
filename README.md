### [Restosphene's Sieve](./RestosphenesSieve/)
A Resptosphene's Sieve is a grid where you systematicaly cross out all of the composite numbers and you are left with all of the primes. Usualy the top left corner is one but I made it be zero because it made it easier to implement. Also there are no numbers drawn; I only filled in the squares.
