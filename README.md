# Math

This repository contains various small projects that are based on maths concepts.

### [Windmill](./Windmill/)

Inspired by 3blue1brown.

### [Raycasting](./raycasting/)

Cool 3d spheres demo

### [Squelch Probability](./SquelchProb/)

Calculating the probability of getting no score in your first roll

### [Fractal Section](./FractalSection/)

An animated cross-section of a sierpinski tetrahedron.

### [Barnsley Fern](./BarnsleyFern/)

An animation of the generation of a Barnsley Fern.

### [Machine Learning](./ML/)

A collection of ML demos and tests.

### [Recamán Sequence](./Recaman/)

A cool visualized sequence.

### [Abacus Simulator](./AbacusSim/)

A simulation of a Chinese Abacus.

### [Spirograph](./Spirograph/)

A computer simulation of the drawing toy Spirograph.

### [Mandelbrot Fractal](./Mandelbrot/)

This renders a mandelbrot fractal in your browser window (not hardware accelerated).

### [Opposite Corners](./OppositeCorners/)

> Hello From The Other Side

This finds the country on the other side of the globe, or the Antipodal Point.

### [Pi Calculator](./PiCalculator/)

This is a variety of ways that you can approximate pi.

### [Conway's Game of Life](./GameOfLife/)

This is the traditional Game of Life... with a twist. There are two different colours and when a cell is born it recieves the color of the majority of it's parents. There will always be a dominant colour because a in order to be born a cell must have three live neighboors and three is odd. Once it is given a color, the cell keeps its colour until it dies.

### [Restosphene's Sieve](./RestosphenesSieve/)

A Restosphene's Sieve is a grid where you systematicaly cross out all of the composite numbers and you are left with all of the primes. Usualy the top left corner is one but I made it be zero because it made it easier to implement. Also there are no numbers drawn; I only filled in the squares.

### [Multiplication Circles](./MultiplicationCircles/)

This uses modular or 'clock' arithematic; so called because of it's appearance in analogue clocks. A series of points are placed evenly around a circle's circumference and are labeled with numbers starting at zero. A number is also chosen to multiply by. Then each point is connected to the point with the number `tn mod p` where _t_ is the number chosen to multiply by, _n_ is the number of the starting point, and _p_ is the total number of points.

### [Root To Fraction](./Root2Fraction/)

This finds vulgar fractions with numbers under 100 that are close to the square root of a given number.
