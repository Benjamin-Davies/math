This uses modular or 'clock' arithematic; so called because of it's appearance in analogue clocks. A series of points are placed evenly around a circle's circumference and are labeled with numbers starting at zero. A number is also chosen to multiply by. Then each point is connected to the point with the number `tn mod p` where _t_ is the number chosen to multiply by, _n_ is the number of the starting point, and _p_ is the total number of points.
