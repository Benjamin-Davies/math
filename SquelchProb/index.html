  <h1>Squelch Probability</h1>
  <h2>Calculating the probability of getting no score in your first roll</h2>
  <h3>Intro</h3>
  <p>In our math class, when we are studying probability we usualy play dice games, as dice are directly linked to probability.
    One of our teacher's favourite dice games is Squelch.</p>
  <p>In Squelch, when it is your turn, you roll the dice repeatedly until you either decide to keep what you have, or you roll
    and you can't score. This means that the first step to understanding the probaility of Squelch is to be able to find
    the probability that you can not score on a given roll.</p>
  <p>There are three main dice combos that you can score with in Squelch. They are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Singular one or five,</li>
    <li>Three the same,</li>
    <li>Short or long straight (five or six consecutive dice),</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Aim</h3>
  <p>I wonder what the probability is of not scoring on your first roll in Squelch.</p>
  <h3>Plan</h3>
  <p>I will write some code (in javascript =D) that will cycle through all of the possible permutaions that you can get from
    rolling six dice. For each permutation, I will then check if you can score at all with those dice.</p>
  <p>It will check for a one or a five, and then it will check for any triples. It will not need to check for straights as any
    straight (12345, 23456, 123456) contains a five and it will have already checked for that.</p>
  <h3>Data &amp; Analysis</h3>
  <p>Below are live counts of the calculated percentage, fraction and simplified fraction.</p>
  <p>The graph shows a cumulative total of the number of loosing combinations discovered.</p>
  <div id="container"></div>
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>The output of my app shows that the probability of not scoring on your first roll in Squelch is 5/162 or 3.086%. This is
    a very low probability and it shows that if you have six dice left then in most cases you are better of taking the chance.</p>
  <p>An interesting feature in the graph is where the total plateus. This is caused by a large number of rolls all having either
    a one or a five.</p>
